torcurve-rs
=========================

A reusable implementation of [Toracdo's generalized, parameterized curve formula for generating lots of different curve shapes useful for easing, etc.](https://twitter.com/torcado/status/1490070852494372870)

## Authorship

Note, I'm not the original creator of the formula. I just wanted a Rust implementation and figured I should share.

## Usage
Add `torcurve-rs = 0.1` to your dependencies

`torcurve_rs::torcurve()`
