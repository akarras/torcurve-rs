A reusable implementation of [toracdo's generalized, parameterized curve formula for generating lots of different curve shapes useful for easing, etc.](https://twitter.com/torcado/status/1490070852494372870)

Zero dependencies, and exposes a single function.

## Authorship
Note, I'm not the original creator of the formula. I just wanted a Rust implementation and figured I should share.

## Usage
Add `torcurve-rs = 0.1` to your dependencies

```rs
use torcurve_rs::torcurve;
fn run_code() {
    for i in 0..=10 {
         println!("curve {}", torcurve(i as f64 * 0.1, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0));
    }
}
```
